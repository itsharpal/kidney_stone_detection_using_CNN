# 🧠 Kidney Stone Detection using CNN (TensorFlow)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network to detect kidney stones in CT scan images. Built using TensorFlow and deployed using Gradio.

## 🔍 Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN with BatchNorm, Dropout, Adam optimizer
- Class imbalance handling with computed weights
- Gradio Web UI for predictions
